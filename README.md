# Recurrent_Neural_Network
Implementing  Recurrent Neural Network from scratch!
Another tutorial on implementation of Recurrent Neural Network to predict sum of numbers in binary

# Files
The file 'rnn_binary_sum' trains the RNN on a random dataset and stores the learned parameters in the file 'save_weights'. 'rnn_predictor'
uses this file to load weights and predict the sum of two numbers as given by user [Sum should be less than '2**seq_len' for which we have trained the network]
File ''Equations and Tutorial' contains equations used and tutorial(to be added soon).
